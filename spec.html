        <p class ="paragraph_extra">The Nerve Gear is an afforable and portable VR headset meant to enhance your VR experience by influencing more than just your hearing and sight. The Nerve Gear adds onto your sensual experience  as it allows players to experience the virtual world physically. By using Microwave Transceivers, the Nerve Gear simulates and delivers physical experiences to the user so that they may experience their best VR experience. Users can experience a soft plush bed in a cozy home warmed by a fireplace, or they may experience cuts and bruises while in an intense fight with another user. To further the experience and bring some extra adrenaline for users, within compatable VR titles, if the user experiences death, the headset will amp up the Microwaves provided by the Transceivers to bring an intense feeling of pain. However, this feature will be turned off by default, and will be age-restricted.</p>
